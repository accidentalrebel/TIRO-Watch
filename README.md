# TIRO-Watch
TIRO (Time is Running Out) Wearable Watch

## Status
Project is still ongoing. Follow the progress of the project on my [Hackaday.io project page](https://hackaday.io/project/164144-tiro-vibrating-watch).

## Description
This project was inspired by the character White Rose in the Mr. Robot TV Series. The character's watch beeps every minute that serves as a reminder to her and everyone else how much she values her time. My project will be different from the TV show because it will vibrate instead of beep. It's more discreet so that it won't drive other people crazy.
